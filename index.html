    <h1>Cat</h1>
    <h2>1. Cats have highly developed senses</h2>
    <p>
        they can detect higher frequencies of sound than dogs or humans, and have an excellent sense of smell - better than ours! They can see better than us in dark and dim light.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Cats are expert hunters and hunt alone.</h2>
    <p>
        In the wild, they'll spend 6-8 hours a day hunting. They can hear the high-pitched frequencies used by small rodents and their whiskers (or 'vibrissae') are highly sensitive to vibrations, helping them to detect prey.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Cats are agile</h2>
    <p>
        they have powerful, tightly controlled muscles and fast reflexes that allow them to move quickly and gracefully. They are skilled at running, jumping, climbing and stealthily stalking prey.
